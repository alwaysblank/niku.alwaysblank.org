#portlandburgerweek burger number 7 was the Big Mike at EastBurn Public House. The sauce was excellent (and deliciously mustard-y), but could have been applied more liberally, and the fried pickles were great, when I found them. Overall a good burger kept from greatness by conservative application of ingredients (and some not great lettuce). EastBurn is a well-oiled machine, though: I came in at 5:45pm and had my burger inside of 15 minutes.
