My first post-burger-week post!

Burger Week was a worthwhile endeavor, but it wasn't cheap. So this week, isntead of eating lunch out I went down the street to the grocery store and bought the following items:

- Marble rye bread
- Deli sliced turkey (peppered and and herb-garlic)
- Some kind of microgreens (maybe peas? I can't recall)
- Horseradish Sriracha mayo
- Honey champagne mustard
- "Old Croc" extra sharp cheddar (it's too sharp to slice properly: it just crumbles)

And every day for lunch in ~5-10 minutes I made the delicious sandwich you see here. I had a tendency to pile a little too much turkey on, which would have been a serious problem with low-quality turkey, but I'd mistakenly bought a little more than I needed and didn't want it to go bad before I'd eaten it all. If you want to make this sandwich, though, I'd recommend toning down the turkey from what you see here: It's more than it needs, and I could barely fit my mouth around it. For the curious, I ended up using 1.5lbs of turkey across four sandwiches. You could easily do this with just half that.

All in all, though, I feel pretty good about it: The Horserasdish Sriracha mayo & honey champagne mustard combo was a particular hit.
