I'm assuming it takes an hour to make this burger, because that's how long we had to wait once we'd ordered. If so, then not a minute was wasted: Bar Maven's Oregon Black and Blue, my 11th and final burger of #portlandburgerweek, was delicious. Nice, thick patty with perfectly powerful cheese on a bun that was just good enough not to distract from the rest of the meal. If I had a complaint, it would be that that I didn't get much of marionberry spread, which I was pretty excited about. On the flip side, this burger got me to eat kale and enjoy the experience so...it's got that going for it.

The first photo makes it look very small, but don't be fooled: This is a meal, not a slider.
