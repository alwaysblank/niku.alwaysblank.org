Burger number 5 in this year's #portlandburgerweek, the Nacho Burger at the Bit House Saloon. We arrived at the right time: we watched the line grow to fill the front of the bar as we ate our burgers. The burger itself was excellent: great balance of flavors with spicy sauce I didn't expect to like as much as I did--they pour a bunch on so you can mop up the excess with your burger, which may not sound appetizing, but was delightful. Strongly recommend this burger, but don't come during the rush.
