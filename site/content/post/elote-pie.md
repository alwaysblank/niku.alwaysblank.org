I was hoping for something that tasted like elote. This wasn't that. It's got some good garlic flavor,
and a very nice chipotle-y sauce, but there's less corn on the slice than there could (or should) be,
and there's no mayo or lime.

Is it a good slice of pizza? Sure, I'd eat another. Does it taste like elote? No, not really.

Their caesar salad is pretty decent too.

#### Sidenote

I haven't tried this out, _but_ if I were to try and make my own elote slice, it would probably look a
little like this:

  1. Make a sauce-less cheese-based slice, with parmesan and a little cotija.
  2. After slice is cooked, chop some corn off a cooked cob onto the pizza.
  3. Drizzle with a mayo and chili/chipotle sauce.
  4. Serve with a slice of lime.
