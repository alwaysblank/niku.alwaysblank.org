A few weeks ago, I told you about a [sandwich I made](/post/turkey-rye/) at work. It was an okay sandwich, but after eating that sandwich for a week, I decided I could do better.

One of my favorite sandwiches in the world is made by [Bunk Sandwiches](http://www.bunksandwiches.com/) and it is called the **Italian Cured Meats**. It is the following ingredients, more or less:

- ham
- salami cotto
- mortadella
- capicola
- marinated peppers
- provolone piccante

That's a tasty sandwich! The marinated peppers are a particular highlight, especially for someone (me) who spent most of his life...not eating peppers unless they had literally been liquified.

> Short side-note about the peppers: Bunk makes them, and serves them up from what looks like a 2-gallon bucket. They sit in that bucket all day--perhaps longer--which means there are roughly two kinds of peppers: "top of the bucket" and "bottom of the bucket". They're both good, but one of them will turn your tongue to molten slurry and burn your eyes out of your head if you are stupid enough to rub your eyes after eating some.

I can't afford to get one of these sandwiches on the regular (with tip, because I'm not a monster, we're talking a ~$13 sando, which is beyond my everyday budget) so I decided to take a rough stab at making one. Here's what goes into mine:

- ham
- salami (depends on what I feel like getting at the store)
- greens (usually some kind of large sprouts)
- [Old Croc cheddar cheese](http://oldcroccheese.com/)
- [Mama Lil's peppers](http://www.mamalils.com/)
- "Italian demi baguette"
- Garlic spread of some kind

So by now you might be wondering why I called this the **Iterative Sandwich**. The reason is simple: I've been make this sandwich for lunch, four days a week, for about 3 weeks. I have tried many slight variations and learned things that work and do not work. Each sandwich is slightly improved from the sandwich before it. For instance, intially I cut the bun sideways, like a hoagie, but the construction of the "Italian demi baguette" meant that when I did this, the top fell apart, so I switched to slicing down from the top. This causes a fat wedge of meat in the middle, which kept the ingredients from spreading out, so I started cutting slices in the sides after cutting down, and then tucking the meat into those slices to flatten in out. This has improved matters, but I'm still working on getting all the ingredients properly spread out so that each bit of the sandwich gets you a little of all of them.

Part of what makes this process work is that I'm eating the sandwich day after day: My memory of my successes and failures is very fresh, which makes it easy to improve or discard ideas and techniques. Unfortunately, it's starting to look like eating a steadily increasing amount of pickled hot peppers every day is not doing my stomach any favors. If you're interested in how to make the current version of the iterative sandwich, please take a look at the images below.
