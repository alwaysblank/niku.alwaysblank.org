The Burnside Brewing Cornholio had the unintended honor of being #portlandburgerweek burger number 10. A solid but unexceptional meal, save for the incredible jalapeno cream cheese. Was it just jalapenos and cream cheese, or something more complex? Whatever it was made of the combination was delicious, and it convinced some of the other mediocre ingredients (slightly stale chicharr√≥n, not really roasted corn, bland bun) to come together into a pretty decent burger. Sadly I think they've run out, and this is the last day of Burger Week, so now the Cornholio is no more.
