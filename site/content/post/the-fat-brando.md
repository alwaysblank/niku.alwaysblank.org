The number 8 burger for this year's #portlandburgerweek is the Fat Brando from Home: A Bar, and for the second year in a row they took something that sounds nasty and made it delicious. The Fat Brando isn't the same triumph that last year's "Picnic" burger was (it ends up being a favorite for both me and Marina), but it's a tasty balance of flavors and not the horrifying grease pile (the horror...the horror...) it looks like in the official photography. In fact, in a possible Burger Week first, the real thing actually looks *better* than the promo shots.
